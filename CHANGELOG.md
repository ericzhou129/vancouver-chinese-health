## 2025-01-03 - Social Media Preview Implementation

### What Was Requested
- Make website links show article previews when shared on social media (especially WeChat)
- Create a content management system for easy article publishing
- Build functionality for editing/republishing articles
- Create a system to easily update the WeChat QR code

### What Was Implemented

#### 1. Social Media Preview Support ✅
- Created individual HTML pages for each article with Open Graph meta tags
- Added pages: `/healthcare-guide/index.html` and `/msp-insurance-guide/index.html`
- These pages auto-redirect to the main site while preserving SEO
- Added engaging titles with【必读】and【收藏】tags
- Included emoji and questions in descriptions for better engagement
- Added WeChat-specific meta tags using `itemprop`

#### 2. Content Management System ✅
- Created `/admin.html` with three tabs:
  - Article Management: Form to generate new article pages
  - QR Code Management: Upload and preview new QR codes
  - Site Settings: Update basic site information
- Created `/data/articles.json` for centralized article metadata
- Added article preview functionality

#### 3. URL Structure ✅
- Preserved backward compatibility - all `#hash` URLs still work
- New shareable URLs: `/healthcare-guide` and `/msp-insurance-guide`
- Used directory structure instead of complex routing

#### 4. Additional Tools ✅
- Created `/assets/images/create-og-images.html` for generating social preview images
- Added comprehensive README.md with instructions
- Created .gitignore for clean repository

### Technical Challenges Solved

1. **404 Error Fix**: Initial Vercel deployment failed due to routing issues
   - Removed problematic `vercel.json` and `package.json`
   - Used directory structure (`/article-name/index.html`) for clean URLs

2. **Crawler Detection**: Implemented JavaScript to detect social media bots
   - Regular users get instant redirect to `/#article-name`
   - Crawlers stay on page to read meta tags

3. **WeChat Optimization**: Added specific meta tags that WeChat recognizes
   - Used `itemprop` tags for better WeChat preview
   - Shortened descriptions for mobile viewing

### Files Created/Modified
- Created: `healthcare-guide/index.html`, `msp-insurance-guide/index.html`
- Created: `admin.html`, `data/articles.json`, `README.md`, `.gitignore`
- Created: `assets/images/create-og-images.html`
- Modified: `index.html` (added default meta tags)
- Moved: `wechat-qr-code.jpg` (kept in root)

### Results
- Article links now show proper titles in WeChat (confirmed via screenshot)
- Clean URLs work without 404 errors
- Admin interface ready for content management
- All existing functionality preserved

### Next Steps for User
1. Generate OG images using the provided tool
2. Upload images to `/assets/images/` folder
3. Use admin panel to create new articles
4. Test social sharing on various platforms

### Commits Made
1. Initial implementation with Open Graph tags
2. Fix for 404 error and deployment issues
3. Improved titles for better engagement
4. All changes pushed to GitHub repository
